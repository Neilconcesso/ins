Execute the program using:

```bash
python <cipher_script>.py
```

### 🌐 Running on GitHub Codespaces
1. Open the repository in GitHub and click on the **Code** button.
2. Select **Create Codespace on Main**.
3. Once the Codespace is ready, open the terminal and navigate to the desired cipher folder.
4. Follow the **Running Locally** steps for Python programs.

## 🔑 Ciphers Included

- 🔐 **Playfair Cipher**: Encrypts text in digraphs using a 5x5 matrix.
- 🔄 **Caesar Cipher**: A shift-based substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places.
- 🔢 **Hill Cipher**: A polygraphic substitution cipher using matrix multiplication for encryption.
- 🔠 **MonoAlphabetic Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is mapped to a unique letter in the ciphertext.
- 🎯 **Vigenère Cipher**: A polyalphabetic cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters.
- 🔥 **Feistel Cipher**: A symmetric structure used in block ciphers.
